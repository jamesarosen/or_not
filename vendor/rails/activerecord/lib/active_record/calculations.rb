      # Count operates using three different approaches.
      #
      # * Count all: By not passing any parameters to count, it will return a count of all the rows for the model.
      # * Count using column: By passing a column name to count, it will return a count of all the rows for the model with supplied column present
      # * Count using options will find the row count matched by the options used.
      #
      # The third approach, count using options, accepts an option hash as the only parameter. The options are:
      #
      # * <tt>:conditions</tt>: An SQL fragment like "administrator = 1" or [ "user_name = ?", username ]. See conditions in the intro to ActiveRecord::Base.
      # * <tt>:joins</tt>: Either an SQL fragment for additional joins like "LEFT JOIN comments ON comments.post_id = id" (rarely needed)
      #   or named associations in the same form used for the <tt>:include</tt> option, which will perform an INNER JOIN on the associated table(s).
      #   If the value is a string, then the records will be returned read-only since they will have attributes that do not correspond to the table's columns.
      #   Pass <tt>:readonly => false</tt> to override.
      # * <tt>:include</tt>: Named associations that should be loaded alongside using LEFT OUTER JOINs. The symbols named refer
      #   to already defined associations. When using named associations, count returns the number of DISTINCT items for the model you're counting.
      #   See eager loading under Associations.
      # * <tt>:order</tt>: An SQL fragment like "created_at DESC, name" (really only used with GROUP BY calculations).
      # * <tt>:group</tt>: An attribute name by which the result should be grouped. Uses the GROUP BY SQL-clause.
      # * <tt>:select</tt>: By default, this is * as in SELECT * FROM, but can be changed if you, for example, want to do a join but not
      #   include the joined columns.
      # * <tt>:distinct</tt>: Set this to true to make this a distinct calculation, such as SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT posts.id) ...
      # * <tt>:from</tt> - By default, this is the table name of the class, but can be changed to an alternate table name (or even the name
      #   of a database view).
      #
      # Examples for counting all:
      #   Person.count         # returns the total count of all people
      #
      # Examples for counting by column:
      #   Person.count(:age)  # returns the total count of all people whose age is present in database
      #
      # Examples for count with options:
      #   Person.count(:conditions => "age > 26")
      #   Person.count(:conditions => "age > 26 AND job.salary > 60000", :include => :job) # because of the named association, it finds the DISTINCT count using LEFT OUTER JOIN.
      #   Person.count(:conditions => "age > 26 AND job.salary > 60000", :joins => "LEFT JOIN jobs on jobs.person_id = person.id") # finds the number of rows matching the conditions and joins.
      #   Person.count('id', :conditions => "age > 26") # Performs a COUNT(id)
      #   Person.count(:all, :conditions => "age > 26") # Performs a COUNT(*) (:all is an alias for '*')
      #
      # Note: <tt>Person.count(:all)</tt> will not work because it will use <tt>:all</tt> as the condition.  Use Person.count instead.

      # There are two basic forms of output:
      #   * Single aggregate value: The single value is type cast to Fixnum for COUNT, Float for AVG, and the given column's type for everything else.
      #   * Grouped values: This returns an ordered hash of the values and groups them by the <tt>:group</tt> option.  It takes either a column name, or the name
      #     of a belongs_to association.

      # * <tt>:include</tt>: Eager loading, see Associations for details.  Since calculations don't load anything, the purpose of this is to access fields on joined tables in your conditions, order, or group clauses.
